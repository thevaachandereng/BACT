# Overview

`bayesCT` is a R package for simulation and analysis of adaptive
Bayesian randomized controlled trials under a range of trial designs and
outcome types. Currently, it supports Gaussian, binomial, and
time-to-event. The `bayesCT` package website is available
[here](https://thevaachandereng.github.io/bayesCT/). Please note this
package is still under development.

# Installation

Prior to analyzing your data, the R package needs to be installed. The
easiest way to install `bayesCT` is through CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("bayesCT")
```

There are other additional ways to download `bayesCT`. The first option
is most useful if want to download a specific version of `bayesCT`
(which can be found at
<https://github.com/thevaachandereng/bayesCT/releases>):

``` r
devtools::install_github("thevaachandereng/bayesCT@vx.xx.x")

# or 

devtools::install_version("bayesCT", version = "x.x.x", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

The second option is to download through GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("thevaachandereng/bayesCT")
```

After successful installation, the package must be loaded into the
working space:
