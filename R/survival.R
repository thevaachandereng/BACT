#'
#' @description Function to analyze Bayesian trial for time-to-event data which
#'   allows early stopping and incorporation of historical data using the
#'   discount function approach.
#'
#' @param time vector. exposure time for the subjects. It must be the same
#'   length as the treatment variable.
#' @param event vector. The status indicator, normally 0=alive, 1=dead. Other
#'   choices are TRUE/FALSE (TRUE = death) or 1/2 (2 = death). For censored
#'   data, the status indicator is 0 = right censored, 1 = event at time.
#'   Although unusual, the event indicator can be omitted, in which case all
#'   subjects are assumed to have an event.
#' @param time0 vector. Historical exposure time for the subjects. It must be
#'   the same length as the treatment variable.
#' @param event0 vector. Historical status indicator, normally 0=alive, 1=dead.
#'   Other choices are TRUE/FALSE (TRUE = death) or 1/2 (2 = death). For
#'   censored data, the status indicator is 0 = right censored, 1 = event at
#'   time. Although unusual, the event indicator can be omitted, in which case
#'   all subjects are assumed to have an event.
#' @param treatment0 vector. the historical treatment assignment for patients, 1
#'   for treatment group and 0 for control group.
#' @param surv_time scalar. scalar. Survival time of interest for computing the
#'   probability of survival for a single arm (OPC) trial. Default is overall
#'   (pooled), i.e. current and historical, median survival time.
#' @param breaks vector. Breaks (interval starts) used to compose the breaks of
#'   the piecewise exponential model. Do not include zero. Default breaks are
#'   the quantiles of the input times.
#' @param prior vector. Prior values of the gamma rate, Gamma(a0, b0). The
#'   default is set to Gamma(0.1, 0.1).
