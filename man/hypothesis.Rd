\usage{
hypothesis(
  delta = 0,
  futility_prob = 0.05,
  prob_accept_ha = 0.95,
  expected_success_prob = 0.9,
  alternative = "greater",
  .data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{numeric. Threshold set for margin in null hypothesis. The
default is set to 0.}

\item{futility_prob}{numeric. Probability of futility. The default is 0.05.}

\item{prob_accept_ha}{numeric. Posterior probability of accepting alternative
hypothesis. The default is 0.95.}

\item{expected_success_prob}{numeric. Probability of expected success.}

\item{alternative}{character. The string specifying the alternative
hypothesis, must be one of \code{"greater"} (default), \code{"less"} or
\code{"two.sided"}.}

\item{.data}{NULL. This should not be changed by the user.}
}
\value{
A list with information of hypothesis testing (threshold, futility
  probability, probability of accepting the alternative hypothesis, and
  probability of expected success).
}
\description{
Wrapper function for the hypothesis in the trial.
