\arguments{
\item{p_treatment}{scalar. Proportion of events under the treatment arm.}

\item{p_control}{scalar. Proportion of events under the control arm.}

\item{y0_treatment}{scalar. Number of events for the historical treatment
arm.}

\item{N0_treatment}{scalar. Sample size of the historical treatment arm.}

\item{y0_control}{scalar. Number of events for the historical control arm.}

\item{N0_control}{scalar. Sample size of the historical control arm.}

\item{N_total}{scalar. Total sample size.}

\item{lambda}{vector. Enrollment rates across simulated enrollment times. See
\code{\link{enrollment}} for more details.}

\item{lambda_time}{vector. Enrollment time(s) at which the enrollment rates
change. Must be same length as lambda. See \code{\link{enrollment}} for
more details.}

\item{interim_look}{vector. Sample size for each interim look. Note: the
maximum sample size should not be included.}

\item{EndofStudy}{scalar. Length of the study.}

\item{prior}{vector. Prior values of beta rate, Beta(a0, b0). The default is
set to Beta(1, 1).}

\item{block}{scalar. Block size for generating the randomization schedule.}

\item{rand_ratio}{vector. Randomization allocation for the ratio of control
to treatment. Integer values mapping the size of the block. See
\code{\link{randomization}} for more details.}

\item{prop_loss_to_followup}{scalar. Overall oroportion of subjects lost to
follow-up.}

\item{alternative}{character. The string specifying the alternative
hypothesis, must be one of \code{"greater"} (default), \code{"less"} or
\code{"two.sided"}.}

\item{h0}{scalar. Threshold for comparing two mean values. Default is
\code{h0=0}.}

\item{futility_prob}{scalar. Probability of stopping early for futility.}

\item{expected_success_prob}{scalar. Probability of stopping early for success.}

\item{prob_ha}{scalar. Probability of alternative hypothesis.}

\item{N_impute}{scalar. Number of imputations for Monte Carlo simulation of
missing data.}

\item{number_mcmc}{scalar. Number of Monte Carlo Markov Chain draws in
sampling posterior.}

\item{discount_function}{character. If incorporating historical data, specify
the discount function. Currently supports the Weibull function
(\code{discount_function="weibull"}), the scaled-Weibull function
(\code{discount_function="scaledweibull"}), and the identity function
(\code{discount_function="identity"}). The scaled-Weibull discount function
scales the output of the Weibull CDF to have a max value of 1. The identity
discount function uses the posterior probability directly as the discount
weight. Default value is \code{"identity"}. See \code{\link{bdpnormal}} for
more details.}

\item{alpha_max}{scalar. Maximum weight the discount function can apply.
Default is 1. For a two-arm trial, users may specify a vector of two values
where the first value is used to weight the historical treatment group and
the second value is used to weight the historical control group.}

\item{fix_alpha}{logical. Fix alpha at alpha_max? Default value is FALSE.}

\item{weibull_scale}{scalar. Scale parameter of the Weibull discount function
used to compute alpha, the weight parameter of the historical data. Default
value is 0.135. For a two-arm trial, users may specify a vector of two
values where the first value is used to estimate the weight of the
historical treatment group and the second value is used to estimate the
weight of the historical control group. Not used when discount_function =
"identity".}

\item{weibull_shape}{scalar. Shape parameter of the Weibull discount function
used to compute alpha, the weight parameter of the historical data. Default
value is 3. For a two-arm trial, users may specify a vector of two values
where the first value is used to estimate the weight of the historical
treatment group and the second value is used to estimate the weight of the
historical control group. Not used when discount_function = "identity".}

\item{method}{character. Analysis method with respect to estimation of the weight
paramter alpha. Default method "\code{mc}" estimates alpha for each
Monte Carlo iteration. Alternate value "\code{fixed}" estimates alpha once
and holds it fixed throughout the analysis.  See the the
\code{bdpsurvival} vignette \cr
\code{vignette("bdpsurvival-vignette", package="bayesDP")} for more details.}
