\usage{
analysis(input, type = "binomial", .data = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{list. Input function for all the analysis.}

\item{type}{character. Type of analysis to be ran (binomial (default),
normal. etc.).}

\item{.data}{NULL. Stores the binomial data for analysis. Should not be
edited by user.}
}
\value{
A list with results of the analysis of Bayesian trial.

\describe{
  \item{\code{prob_of_accepting_alternative}}{
    scalar. The input parameter of probability of accepting the alternative.}
  \item{\code{margin}}{
    scalar. The margin input value of difference between mean estimate of treatment
     and mean estimate of the control.}
  \item{\code{alternative}}{
    character. The input parameter of alternative hypothesis.}
  \item{\code{N_treatment}}{
    scalar. The number of patients enrolled in the experimental group for
    each simulation.}
  \item{\code{N_control}}{
    scalar. The number of patients enrolled in the control group for
    each simulation.}
  \item{\code{N_enrolled}}{
    vector. The number of patients enrolled in the trial (sum of control
    and experimental group for each simulation.)}
  \item{\code{N_complete}}{
    scalar. The number of patients who completed the trial and had no
    loss to follow-up.}
  \item{\code{post_prob_accept_alternative}}{
    vector. The final probability of accepting the alternative
    hypothesis after the analysis is done.}
  \item{\code{est_final}}{
    scalar. The final estimate of the difference in posterior estimate of
    treatment and posterior estimate of the control group.}
  \item{\code{stop_futility}}{
    scalar. Did the trial stop for futility during imputation of patient
    who had loss to follow up? 1 for yes and 0 for no.}
  \item{\code{stop_expected_success}}{
    scalar. Did the trial stop for early success during imputation of patient
    who had loss to follow up? 1 for yes and 0 for no.}
