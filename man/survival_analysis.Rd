\arguments{
\item{time}{vector. exposure time for the subjects. It must be the same length
as the treatment variable.}

\item{treatment}{vector. Treatment assignment for patients, 1 for treatment
group and 0 for control group}

\item{event}{vector. The status indicator, normally 0=alive, 1=dead.
Other choices are TRUE/FALSE (TRUE = death) or 1/2 (2=death).
For censored data, the status indicator is 0=right censored, 1 = event at time.
Although unusual, the event indicator can be omitted, in which case
all subjects are assumed to have an event.}

\item{time0}{vector. Historical exposure time for the subjects. It must be the same length
as the treatment variable.}

\item{treatment0}{vector. the historical treatment assignment for patients,
1 for treatment group and 0 for control group.}

\item{event0}{vector. Historical status indicator, normally 0=alive, 1=dead.
Other choices are TRUE/FALSE (TRUE = death) or 1/2 (2=death).
For censored data, the status indicator is 0=right censored, 1 = event at time.
Although unusual, the event indicator can be omitted, in which case
all subjects are assumed to have an event.}

\item{surv_time}{scalar. scalar. Survival time of interest for computing the probability
of survival for a single arm (OPC) trial. Default is overall, i.e.,
current+historical, median survival time.}

\item{h0}{scalar. Threshold for comparing two mean values. Default is
\code{h0=0}.}

\item{breaks}{vector. Breaks (interval starts) used to compose the breaks of the piecewise
exponential model. Do not include zero. Default breaks are the quantiles of the input
times.}

\item{alternative}{character. The string specifying the alternative
hypothesis, must be one of \code{"greater"} (default), \code{"less"} or
\code{"two.sided"}.}

\item{N_impute}{scalar. Number of imputations for Monte Carlo simulation of
missing data.}

\item{number_mcmc}{scalar. Number of Monte Carlo Markov Chain draws in
sampling posterior.}

\item{prob_ha}{scalar. Probability of alternative hypothesis.}

\item{futility_prob}{scalar. Probability of stopping early for futility.}

\item{expected_success_prob}{scalar. Probability of stopping early for success.}

\item{prior}{vector. Prior values of the gamma rate, Gamma(a0, b0). The default is
set to Gamma(.1, .1).}

\item{discount_function}{character. If incorporating historical data, specify
the discount function. Currently supports the Weibull function
(\code{discount_function="weibull"}), the scaled-Weibull function
(\code{discount_function="scaledweibull"}), and the identity function
(\code{discount_function="identity"}). The scaled-Weibull discount function
scales the output of the Weibull CDF to have a max value of 1. The identity
discount function uses the posterior probability directly as the discount
weight. Default value is \code{"identity"}. See \code{\link{bdpnormal}} for
more details.}

\item{fix_alpha}{logical. Fix alpha at alpha_max? Default value is FALSE.}

\item{alpha_max}{scalar. Maximum weight the discount function can apply.
Default is 1. For a two-arm trial, users may specify a vector of two values
where the first value is used to weight the historical treatment group and
the second value is used to weight the historical control group.}

\item{weibull_scale}{scalar. Scale parameter of the Weibull discount function
used to compute alpha, the weight parameter of the historical data. Default
value is 0.135. For a two-arm trial, users may specify a vector of two
values where the first value is used to estimate the weight of the
historical treatment group and the second value is used to estimate the
weight of the historical control group. Not used when discount_function =
"identity".}

\item{weibull_shape}{scalar. Shape parameter of the Weibull discount function
used to compute alpha, the weight parameter of the historical data. Default
value is 3. For a two-arm trial, users may specify a vector of two values
where the first value is used to estimate the weight of the historical
treatment group and the second value is used to estimate the weight of the
historical control group. Not used when discount_function = "identity".}

\item{method}{character. Analysis method with respect to estimation of the weight
parameter alpha. Default method "\code{mc}" estimates alpha for each
Monte Carlo iteration. Alternate value "\code{fixed}" estimates alpha once
and holds it fixed throughout the analysis.  See the the
\code{bdpsurvival} vignette \cr
\code{vignette("bdpsurvival-vignette", package="bayesDP")} for more details.}
